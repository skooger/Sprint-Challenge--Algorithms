#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) - It iterates n^3, but increments n^2 every iteration


b) O(nlogn) - The first loop is O(n) but the while loop is j < n and j increments j * 2 every iteration


c) O(n) - The addition in the return statement is is O(1), but the number of recursive calls is directly proportionate to the size of n making O(n)

## Exercise II

I would use a binary search implementation. I would first go down n/2 floors, where n is starting at the top floor. See if the egg breaks. If it breaks we go down n/2 agian, where n this time is our current floor.
